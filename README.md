# Current Status

In development

# Python - TG BOT - YYG

This bot is used to simplify the app you installed in your phone.
In China mainland, The Android APP eco system is really terrible.

I was concerned about the PackageTracker APP. But it always push the info I don
't want.
I hate to install a lot of "Chinese Malware APP" on my phone. So, now I use Tel
egram as much as possible.
As the most powerful Bot API I have ever seen, I hope that, one day in the futu
re I could only use Telegram to do most of my life.
